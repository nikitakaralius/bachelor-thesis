# ChkTeX configuration file
# Suppress specific warnings by uncommenting the ones you want to disable

# Common warnings to suppress:
# Warning 1  = Command terminated with space
# Warning 8  = Wrong length of dash (may be correct)
# Warning 13 = Intersentence spacing (`\ ') should perhaps be used
# Warning 36 = You should put a space in front of parenthesis

# To suppress warnings, add them to CmdLine
# Example: CmdLine { -n1 -n8 -n13 }

# Uncomment and customize as needed:
# CmdLine { -n1 -n8 }

# Quote style preferences - use formal quotes
QuoteStyle { Formal }

# Dash length preferences - allow both -- and ---
DashExcpt { }
