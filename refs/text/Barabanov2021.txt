SECURITY AUDIT LOGGING IN MICROSERVICE-BASED
SYSTEMS: SURVEY OF ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS
Barabanov A. 1, Makrushin D.2
Abstract
Objective. Service-oriented architecture increases technical abilities for attacker to move laterally and maintain
multiple pivot points inside of compromised environment. Microservice-based infrastructure brings more challenges
for security architect related to internal event visibility and monitoring. Properly implemented logging and audit approach is a baseline for security operations and incident management. The aim of this study is to provide helpful
resource to application and product security architects, software and operation engineers on existing architecture
patterns to implement trustworthy logging and audit process in microservice-based environments.
Method. In this paper, we conduct information security threats modeling and a systematic review of major electronic databases and libraries, security standards and presentations at the major security conferences as well as
architecture whitepapers of industry vendors with relevant products.
Results and practical relevance. In this work based on research papers and major security conferences presentations analysis, we identified industry best practices in logging audit patterns and its applicability depending on environment characteristic. We provided threat modeling for typical architecture pattern of logging system and identified
8 information security threats. We provided security threat mitigation and as a result of 11 high-level security requirements for audit logging system were identified. High-level security requirements can be used by application security
architect in order to secure their products.
Keywords: microservices, microservice architectures, security, operations, audit, logging, architecture patterns
survey.

1. Introduction
Logging service in microservice-based systems is aim
to meet principle of accountability and traceability and
help to detect anomalies in operations via log analysis.
Therefore, it is vital for applications security architects to
understand and properly use existing architecture patterns to implement audit logging in microservices-based
systems for security operations. The goal of our research
was to identify such patterns and to do recommendations
for applications security architect and security operations
specialists on possible way to use it. This study is conducted with three main questions in mind:
• Threat modeling: what information security threats are
exists for typical audit logging system in microservicebased applications?
• Security Design: what security control can be used
while designing logging system to mitigate existing security threats?
• Implementation: What should application security architect take in mind while implementing audit logging
system in microservice-based systems?
We provide threat modeling of simple logging system architecture pattern and reviewed major electronic
databases and libraries (IEEE Xplorer, ACM Digital Li-

brary, SpringerLink, ResearchGate, arXiv) with research
papers to extract primary studies. In order to explore
these sources, we used search strings containing “logging”, “audit”, “monitoring”, “log analysis”, “security
operations”, “service-oriented architecture” and “microservice” (in different spelling, like “micro-service” or
“micro service”) words. To avoid missing relevant studies, we also reviewed security standards, presentations
at the major security conferences and technical documents (whitepapaers) by industry vendors with mature
microservice-based products.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
• threat model for typical logging system architecture
pattern (Section 2);
• a set of security controls and mitigations techniques as
well as non-functional requirements to the log format
and set of auditable events (Section 3);
• recommendations for applications security architect
on how to implement audit logging system in microservice-based applications (Section 4).
This article continues a set of articles dedicated to
microservice-based system security [14].

2. Threat Model for Audit Logging System
We provided security design review in order to define
typical security threats and mitigation techniques. To define security threats we used STRIDE methodology [1], [3],

CAPEC [2] repository and best practices analysis. During
best practices analysis we analyzed architectural patterns
used in the wild and presented at application security

Th#1

Service spoofing: a malicious or compromised microservice can send log
message to the logging subsystem to forge logs

Th#2

Logging/transport system spoofing: a malicious service can act as a
logging subsystem in order to get access to sensitive information

CAPEC-151: Identity Spoofing

Th#3

Logging system denial-of-service (DoS): data loss due to logging service
failure in case of attack on logging service. In that case log messages
needed to be buffered on the microservice side in memory. As the
microservice buffer size is limited, an extended logging service outage
would lead to log message loss

CAPEC-125: Flooding

to logging subsystem via communication channel) to make it contain
something other than what the original content producer (microservice)
intended while keeping the apparent source of the content unchanged

Legitimate microservice (due to attack) can elevate its privileges in order
to read sensitive information from logging service

Th#7

Data loss due to logging service failure in case of its flooding by legitimate
microservice (highload environment). In that case log messages needed
to be buffered on the microservice side in memory. As the microservice
buffer size is limited, an extended logging service outage would lead to log
message loss.

Security audit logging in microservice-based systems: survey of architecture patterns

Figure 2. Logging pattern “Logging agent”
conferences3, 4, 5. A naive pattern of logging subsystem is
shown on the picture below (Figure 1). Microservice directly sends their log message to central logging service
via network requests using logging library (e.g., log4j for
Java-based applications).
We identify 8 threat categories against audit logging
subsystems (Table 1) for the mentioned naïve pattern of
logging subsystem. It should be mention, that our security design review was scoped only to collection layer and
transport/streaming layer [4]. Other layers (analysis, storage and access) was out of the current research scope
(e.g. security threats to log storage integrity).
3. Audit logging system security
controls and requirements
Then we analyzed identified security threats as well as
best practices [4], [6], [7], [8], [9] adopted by community
and industry vendors with mature product security program in order to identify high-level requirement for logging
subsystem. A high-level architecture design is shown on
the picture below (Figure 2):
• microservice writes a log messages to local file using
standard output (via stdout, stderr);
• logging agent periodically pulls log messages and
sends (publish) it to message broker;
• central logging service subscribes on messages in
message broker, receives and process it.
Logging agent can be deployed using daemonset in

Kubernetes environment6 or sidecar pattern7.
We analyzed several research papers, books and presentations [4]8, to identify a set of events that should

be logged. Possible auditable events at microservice/application level are presented in the table below (Table 3).

Figure 3. Access control decision log
example (Open Policy Agent)
Using structured logs format (e.g., JSON, CSV) is a widely
used pattern. It is advisable to define a structure for log
events among development teams. The following example
(Figure 4) shows log message in mozlog format [4]
Figure 4. Log example (mozlog library)
Possible log message fields are listed in the table below (Table 4).
4. Recommendations for application
security architects
Based on our survey results, we came up with several
recommendations for application security architects on audit logging implementation:
1) Centralized logging service allow to collect, stream,
analyze, store, and access log events. Using a centralized
logging service that aggregates logs from each service instance is a widely used pattern. To mitigate typical threats
related with logging system it is advisable to use logging
agents and publish-subscribe pattern.
2) Audit logging solution should be infrastructure/
operations-level solution and dedicated team (e.g., Infra-

Table 2
High-level requirements to logging subsystem architecture with its rationales are listed in table below
High-level requirement definition

Rational
Mitigated threats:

Microservice shall not send log message directly
to central logging subsystem using network
communication. Microservice shall write its log
message to a local log file.

There shall be a dedicated component (logging
agent) decoupled from microservice. Logging
agent shall collect log data on microservice side
(read local log file) and send it to central logging
subsystem.
Due to possible network latency issues logging
agent shall be deployed on the same host (virtual or physical machine) with microservice.
Due to possible DoS-attack on central logging
subsystem logging agent shall not uses
synchronous request/response pattern to send
log messages. There shall be message broker to
implement asynchronous connection between
logging agent and central logging service.
Logging agent and message broker shall use
mutual authentication (e.g. based on TLS) to
encrypt all transmitted (log messages) and
authenticate themselves.

• Th#3 Data loss due to logging service failure (due to attack):
in case of logging service outage microservice will still write
log messages to the local file (without data loss), after logging
service recovery logs will be available to shipping
• Th#7 Data loss due to logging service failure in case of its
flooding by legitimate microservice (highload environment):
in case of logging service outage microservice will still write
log messages to the local file (without data loss), after logging
service recovery logs will be available to shipping
Mitigated threats:
• Th#3 Data loss due to logging service failure (due to attack):
isolate microservice from logging agent failure ‑ in case of
logging agent failure microservice still writes information to
the log file, logging agent after recovery will read file and send
information to message broker;
Mitigated threats:
• Th#7 Data loss due to logging service failure in case of its
flooding by legitimate microservice (highload environment):
using asynchronous mechanism allows to mitigate possible
DoS-attack from legitimate microservices because microservice process amount of information it can that do not lead to
exhaustion of microservice resources
Mitigated threats:
• Th#1 Microservice spoofing
• Th#2 Logging/transport system spoofing
• Th#4 Network traffic injection
• Th#5 Sniffing Network Traffic

Message broker shall enforce access control
policy in order to mitigate unauthorized access
and enforce the principle of least privileges

Mitigated threats:

Logging agent shall filter/sanitize output log
messages in order to sensitive data (e.g., PII,
passwords, API keys) will never send to the
central logging subsystem (data minimization
principle)

Mitigated threats:

• Th#6 Microservice elevation of privileges
• Th#8 Microservice may log private or confidential data without
masking/filtering

Message broker shall be deployed in high
availability mode (cluster)

Mitigated threats:
• Th#7 Data loss due to logging service failure in case of its
flooding by legitimate microservice (highload environment)

Microservices shall generate and pass through
microservice call chain a correlation ID which
uniquely identify every call chain and help
grouping log messages to investigate them.
Logging agent shall include correlation ID in
every log message.

Best practices [4]

Logging agent shall periodically provide health
and status data to indicate its availability or
non-availability

blueprint/library/components that implement audit logging among development teams. Audit logging solution
should be easy to implement for development teams and
scalable. It is preferable to ask development teams to use
standard output to write log messages.
3) Application security architect should establish a
baseline related with auditable events, log format and
log message fields and share it among development and
operations teams. Auditable events list should include:
authentication successes and failures, authorization
(access control) failures, application errors and system
events, use of higher-risk functionality, input validation

(e.g., JSON, CSV) is a widely used pattern.
4) Audit logging system should be based on widely
used solution, because implementing custom solution
has following cons:
• security or engineering team have to build and maintain custom solution;
• it is necessary to build and maintain client library SDKs
for every language used in system architecture;
• necessity to train every developer on custom audit API
and integration, and there’s no open source community to source information from.

Security audit logging in microservice-based systems: survey of architecture patterns
5. Related work
Security architecture patterns for microservice-based
systems has been the topic of a number of surveys and
review articles, as well as standards.
Vale et al. [10] conducted a systematic mapping to
reveal adopted security mechanisms for microservicebased systems. They focused only on security mechanisms
and examined 26 papers published from November
2018 to March 2019. Hannousse et al. [11] conducted
a similar investigation to Vale et al. [10] study. Their
study is broader in several ways: they included published
papers since 2011 and besides security mechanisms,
they also focused on identifying security threats and
the applicability of proposed solutions regarding their
execution platforms and architectural layers. Yu et al. [12]
surveyed work related to security risks for microservicesbased fog applications, and argued that security issues
arise in four system aspects: containers, data, permissions

and network security. Nehme et al. [13] discussed how
microservices can be secured at different levels and
stages considering a common software development
lifecycle.
NIST published standards9, 10 on microservice-based
system security. NIST analyzed the multiple implementation options available for each individual core security
feature (authentication and access management, service discovery, secure communication protocols, security monitoring, availability/resiliency improvement techniques, load balancing and throttling, integrity assurance
techniques and handling of session persistence) and configuration options in architectural frameworks, and developed security strategies that counter threats specific to
microservice-based systems.
Compared with the related works our study is more
narrow and concentrated on audit logging function only
in order to get deeper results. Moreover, besides research

6. Conclusion and further work
The survey enumerated several technical publications
and multiple sources and libraries to deliver a source of
insight for application security architects to build trustworthy audit logging system. This document offers the benefit
of providing guidance on needed efforts and research into
how to better secure microservice-based environments.

information to detect security threats. In order to do that
security analyst can use simple patterns based on regular expressions and statistics and threat detection based
machine learning techniques [15], [16]. The work can be
a baseline for future audit logs processing by establishing an efficient hybrid approach that combines classic
techniques to detect threats in microservice-based environment and novel approaches (e.g., machine-learning
based algorithms) to detect anomalies and adversaries in
compromised infrastructure.
