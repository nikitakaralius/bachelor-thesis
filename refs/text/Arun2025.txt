Introduction
In the rapidly evolving landscape of cloud computing,
where 94% of enterprises now utilize cloud services
[1], implementing robust security measures has
become critical for organizational success. Recent
studies indicate that 76% of organizations experienced
a cloud-based security breach in 2023, with 42% of
these incidents directly attributed to improper access
