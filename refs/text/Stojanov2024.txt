Abstract. Microservices are the most promising direction for developing heterogeneous distributed software
systems capable of adapting to dynamic changes in business and technology. In addition to the development of
new software systems, the migration from legacy monolithic systems to microservice architectures is also a
prominent aspect of microservices use. These trends resulted in an increasing number of primary and secondary
studies on microservices, stressing the need for systematization of research at a higher level. The objective of
this study is to comprehensively analyze secondary studies in the field of microservices with objectives to
inquire about publishing trends, research trends, domains of implementation, and future research directions.
The study follows the guidelines for conducting a systematic literature review, which resulted in the findings
derived from 44 secondary studies. The study findings are structured to address the proposed research
objectives. Recommendations for further literature reviews relate to the improvement of quality assessment of
selected studies to increase the validity of findings, a more detailed review of human and organizational factors
through the microservices life cycle, the use of social science qualitative methods for more detailed analysis of
selected studies, and inclusion of gray literature that will bring the real opinions and experiences of experts
from industry.
Keywords: microservices; tertiary study; systematic literature review; research trends; recommendations.

Аннотация. Микросервисы являются наиболее перспективным направлением для разработки
разнородных распределенных программных систем, способных адаптироваться к динамическим
изменениям бизнеса и технологий. В дополнение к разработке новых программных систем, переход от
устаревших монолитных систем к микросервисным архитектурам также является важным аспектом
использования микросервисов. Эти тенденции привели к увеличению числа первичных и вторичных
исследований микросервисов, что подчеркивает необходимость систематизации исследований на более
высоком уровне. Целью настоящего исследования является всесторонний анализ вторичных
исследований в области микросервисов, который поможет выявить тенденции в направленности
публикаций, исследований, уточнить области использования полученных результатов и перспективы
будущих исследований. Представленное исследование следует рекомендациям по проведению
систематического обзора литературы, в процессе его проведения были выявлены результаты 44
вторичных исследований. Эти результаты структурированы в соответствии с сформулированными
авторами целями. Рекомендации для дальнейших обзоров литературы касаются улучшения оценки
качества отдельных исследований для повышения достоверности результатов, повышения детализации
обзоров человеческих и организационных факторов через жизненный цикл микросервисов,
использования качественных методов социальных наук для более подробного анализа отдельных

1. Introduction
Microservices have recently emerged as popular and widely used architectural model for cloudbased applications, representing a new trend in developing distributed software systems [1-2]. As
small and independent services, they offer improved performance and support for continuous
delivery [3]. Microservices based applications are in many cases built by breaking up monolithic
applications, which assumes considering factors such as the number of objects owned by a service,
the level of responsibility, and the team distribution [4]. In the beginning, microservices were
adopted by large companies like Amazon, LinkedIn, and Netflix, and later by other companies [56], leading to an increasing trend in using microservices for developing cloud-based applications.
The adoption of microservices in developing or reengineering software systems includes a new
organizational and business culture in software organizations [7]. Adoption of DevOps in software

companies is crucial for better integration of microservices-based applications throughout the
system life cycle [8], leading to improvement their competitiveness [9].
Microservices-based applications consist of multiple components that collectively form the entire
system. Each component performs a single task, with its boundaries shielding it from external
knowledge, while the processed results can be shared and accessed by other microservices [2]. A
system structure is stable even when upgrades or extensions are necessary. With microservices,
clients can be confident that any changes or growth in their business will be implemented into
software. Microservices show better performance than monolithic architectures, particularly in
terms of meeting business requirements, ensuring systems reliability, enhancing maintainability, and
bolstering infrastructure resilience [2]. Although microservices require a larger number of teams and
greater effort, the long-term benefits make the investment worthwhile [10]. Migration of monolithic
or legacy systems to service-oriented architectures is a common trend in contemporary software
systems [11], particularly to microservice architectures, resulting with improved system
performance [12-13]. Use of design patterns results in improvement of development practices and
better fulfillment of various architectural quality attributes [14].
Microservices-based systems consist of individual microservices, each independently performing a
specific functionality. Consequently, if one microservice fails, the entire system remains unaffected.
The principle of Autonomy is responsible for this behavior, while other key principles are [10]:
Resilience – ensuring that the application can continue providing services even if a specific
microservice encounters failure; Transparency – exposing the necessary details and providing
documentation for each microservice; Automation – employing tools that enhance the efficiency,
reliability, and scalability of the microservices’ building and maintenance processes; and Alignment
– relating to harmonizing different microservices within the system.
Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) [15] and Systematic Mapping Studies (SMSs) [16] have
recently been adopted by software engineering research community, for systematizing and analyzing
the evidence on the practice and leading to Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE) [17].
Review of academic literature, commonly referred to as “white literature”, has recently been
supplemented with “gray literature” sources such as blog posts, white papers, industrial magazines,
and videos, introducing Multivocal Literature Reviews (MLRs) [18].
Based on the above discussion, the objectives of this study are: (1) to present the current publishing
trends of secondary studies research, (2) to determine topics inquired in secondary studies, (3) to
inquire in which domains are microservices commonly implemented, and (4) to present identified
future research directions. A SLR based on the guidelines proposed in [15, 17] was performed,
resulting in 44 secondary studies that were used for drawing research findings and recommendations
for further research.
This paper is structured as follows. The second section presents related work on tertiary studies
related to microservices. The third section outlines the research methods employed in the study,
while the fourth section presents the research findings. Recommendations for future reviews are
discussed in the fifth section. The last section contains conclusions.

Literature Reviews (SLRs), Systematic Mapping Studies (SMSs), Systematic Grey Literature
Reviews (SGLRs), and Multivocal Literature Reviews (MLRs).

2. Related work
Tertiary studies have been recently used in software engineering for reviewing secondary studies
and conducting meta-analyses on specific research topics. Some of the tertiary studies relate to
DevOps [19], architecting systems of systems [20], cloud computing [21], agile software
development [22], variability in software product lines [23], or testing artifact quality [24].
Two tertiary studies on microservices were identified: “Research on Microservice Architecture: A
Tertiary Study” by Liu et al. [25], and the second study titled “Microservice Architecture: A Tertiary
Study” by Costa et al. [26]. Table 1 presents information on the period covered and the number of
secondary studies included in identified tertiary studies. The review types encompass Systematic

Liu et al. [25] conducted a SLR and identified 37 secondary studies on microservices published in
the period from 2016 to 2021. The authors formulated two research questions: (RQ1) What are the
common topics addressed in secondary studies related to microservices architecture (MSA), and
what are their findings? (RQ2) What are the potential areas for new research in the field of MSA?
Quality of the secondary studies was assessed based on the DARE quality criteria [17].
Costa et al. [26] conducted a SLR and identified 22 secondary studies on microservices published
in the period from 2016 to 2019. The original study was written in Portuguese, which required the
translation of methodological issues and results into English. The authors addressed the following
research questions: (RQ1) Which secondary studies have been published in the field of
microservices? (RQ2) What research topics on microservices have been investigated? (RQ3) What
emerging patterns have been identified? (RQ4) What solutions and support tools have been utilized
to facilitate the development and operation of microservices architecture? (RQ5) In which areas,
particularly in the industry, are microservices being applied? (RQ6) Which topics exhibit gaps and
require further exploration in future microservices research? The quality of secondary studies was
assessed by using the DARE quality criteria [17].

3. Research methods
This study is based on the guidelines for conducting SLRs proposed in [15, 17]. The research process
contains the following main phases: (1) planning the review, (2) conducting the review, and (3)
reporting the findings.

3.1 Planning the review
Justification of the need for a tertiary study, determining research questions, selecting digital
databases, and defining the studies search and selection process with clearly stated keywords for
searching, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and quality assessment criteria are described in this section.

3.1.1 Need to conduct a tertiary study on microservices
In the last decade, research on microservices has gained popularity by the researchers, resulting in
an increasing number of empirical studies and leading to the execution of systematic reviews. These
reviews were performed as SLRs [15], SMSs [16], and even MLRs [18].
During the search of literature on microservices, two tertiary studies on microservices were
identified: a study titled “Research on Microservice Architecture: A Tertiary Study” by Liu et al.
[25], and a study titled “Microservice Architecture: A Tertiary Study” by Costa et al. [26]. Insights
into these two studies revealed a consistent increase in the number of secondary studies over the
years, and it can be expected that this trend will continue in 2023 and beyond, highlighting the need
for new reviews of recent secondary research.

3.1.2 Research questions
The following research questions (RQs) are proposed:
RQ1: What are the publishing trends observed in secondary studies?
RQ2: What are the predominant topics investigated in secondary studies?
RQ3: In which domains are microservices commonly implemented?
RQ4: What future research directions have been identified?

3.1.3 Search and selection process of secondary studies

3.2 Conducting the review

Proposed research questions were used for selecting keywords for searching for secondary studies.
Keywords were put into two groups: the first group includes the keywords “microservices” and
“microservices architecture”, while the second group comprises the keywords “SLR”, “Systematic
literature review”, “SMS” and “Systematic mapping study”. The following search strings were
constructed for searching for secondary studies:

The search for secondary studies was performed in January 2023. The first phase resulted in the
identification of 821 papers. The details of the search conducted in digital libraries are presented in
Table 2.

[1]: (“microservices architecture” OR “microservices”) AND (“SLR” OR “Systematic literature review”)

The process of searching and selecting studies contains the following phases (Ph#No):
• Ph#1: Searching digital libraries using constructed search strings.

• Ph#4: Applying inclusion/exclusion criteria to studies that passed phases Ph#2 and Ph#3.
• Ph#5: Conducting a detailed reading and analysis of the studies that passed Ph#4.
The digital libraries used for searching secondary studies are ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore,
ScienceDirect, Springer, Wiley Online Library, and MDPI. These libraries were selected because
they publish a majority of the leading journals and conference proceedings in the field.
Filtering of the studies identified during the search of digital libraries and snowball search was based
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria are: (I1) A study reviews relevant studies
on microservices, (I2) A study follows guidelines for conducting SLR or SMS, (I3) A study answers
research questions in the domain of microservices. Exclusion criteria are: (E1) Full text of a study
is not available, (E2) A study is not peer-reviewed, (E3) The study is less than 6 pages, (E4) A study
is not written in English, (E5) A review study that includes gray literature.
All selected secondary studies were evaluated against these inclusion and exclusion criteria, and if
a secondary study failed to meet even one criterion, it was excluded from further analysis.

The phased process of selecting secondary studies is presented in Fig. 1, while the selection process
of SLRs and SMSs throughout the phases is presented in Table 3.
Filtering in Ph#2 and Ph#3 resulted in the selection of 57 secondary studies. After implementing
inclusion/exclusion criteria on each of the 57 studies, 44 were selected for further analysis and
quality assessment. Three studies were excluded based on the E3 exclusion criterion, one study
based on the E1 exclusion criterion, and nine studies based on the E5 exclusion criterion.

3.1.4 Quality assessment of secondary studies
The secondary studies were evaluated for quality based on guidelines proposed in [17]. The primary
objective of the quality assessment was to identify and exclude low-quality studies from the detailed
analysis and synthesis of review findings. Quality assessment was based on a three-point scale with
values 1 (Yes), 0.5 (Partly), and 0 (No). This scale was based on the five questions (Q2-Q6) proposed
in [17], while an additional question concerning the use of the review methodology (Q1) was added.
The quality assessment questions are:
Q1: Is the review methodology clearly stated and appropriate?
Q2: Are the review's inclusion and exclusion criteria described and appropriate?
Q3: Is the literature search likely to have covered all relevant studies?
Q4: Did the reviewers assess the quality/validity of the included studies?
Q5: Were basic studies adequately described?
Q6: Were the extracted data from included studies synthesized in the findings?
Based on the authors’ agreement, studies with an average quality score of less than 0.5 will be
excluded from the detailed analysis.

3.2.1 Quality assessment
The first, third, and fourth authors assessed the quality of secondary studies, while the second author
reviewed the grades and calculated the average quality scores for all studies. Each evaluator assigned
a mark from the three-point scale (0.0, 0.5, or 1.0) to each study for all quality assessment criteria.
The average quality score for each study was then calculated as the mean of all average values
assigned by each evaluator. Table 4 presents the average scores for the quality assessment of the
selected studies. It is evident that all studies exceeded the minimum required quality threshold for
further analysis (overall quality score greater than 0.50).

Fig. 3. General overview of microservices research topics

Analysis. The analysis of software architecture is crucial for understanding both new software
systems and those that require migration to microservice architectures. It focuses on the following
aspects:
(1) Methods - various methods can be distinguished, including Static Analysis, Dynamic
Analysis, Combined Dynamic and Static Analysis, Model-Based Analysis, Graph-Based
Analysis, and Pattern-Based Analysis;
(2) Tools - specific tools tailored to each analysis method, facilitating automated work; and
(3) Challenges – these encompass architectural analysis, software architecture
reconstruction, technical debt analysis, quality attribute analysis, and fault analysis.
Granularity. Granularity refers to the size of individual microservices within a software system
based on the microservices architecture. It plays a crucial role in determining the functioning of the
system and its quality attributes, including performance, maintainability, data storage, and
scalability. Determining the optimal granularity involves finding the right balance between the level
of functionality encapsulated within each microservice and the need for modularity, maintainability,
and scalability. Insights from the selected studies on granularity reveal the following main subtopics:
(1) Methods or approaches for defining granularity;
(2) Metrics used for evaluating granularity; and
(3) Quality attributes affected by granularity.

Presentation. Efficient design and utilization of microservice-based systems require the
presentation of software architecture through various approaches that depict the system’s structure
and behavior. The secondary studies identified the following subtopics:
(1) Languages – specific languages for describing the architecture, such as RAML, YAML,
Jolie, or various pseudocodes;
(2) Diagrams – visual diagrams, ranging from informal drawings to specialized and
sophisticated diagrams such as Component/Container, Process/Behavior, Sequence,
Execution Timeline, Deployment, Class, Use Case, Type Graph, Instance Graph, and
Dependency Graph; and
(3) Visualization – dynamic analysis techniques, supported with specialized tools, for
analyzing or recovering software architecture.
Quality attributes. Quality characteristics of software systems are typically reflected in the form of
quality attributes, which are associated with non-functional requirements. While there are numerous
quality attributes, it is often challenging to satisfy all of them simultaneously. In such cases, tradeoffs must be made when considering quality attributes. The most common quality attributes
mentioned in many studies are Reliability, Security, Compatibility, Maintainability, Performance,
Portability, Testability, Availability, Monitorability, Scalability, and Modularity. These attributes
have been extensively discussed in various sources and are relevant throughout the software life
cycle, from design to operational use and maintenance. The selected secondary studies also mention
additional quality attributes, such as Modifiability, Usability, Deployability, Flexibility, Reusability,
Manageability, Independence, Traceability, Complexity, Load balancing, and Organizational
alignment. To effectively address quality attributes, appropriate metrics need to be proposed, such
as time, complexity, number of requests, or number of affected files. These metrics facilitate
continuous improvements in quality attributes over time.

among team members and with clients, and aids in meeting quality requirements. The following
categories of patterns are identified:
(1) Design – patterns used for structuring and organizing microservices efficiently (API
gateway, publish/subscribe, circuit breaker, proxy, and load balancer)
(2) Composition – patterns related to composing different microservices in a software system
(semantic annotation, best-fitting, and workload-based approaches);
(3) Communication – patterns related to communication between multiple microservices
(synchronous communication, publish/subscribe communication, combination of HTTP
and message queue, communication using message-oriented middleware, asynchronous
communication, point-to-point communication, and communication using binary
protocols);
(4) Deployment – patterns related to the deployment or distribution of microservices to
multiple resources for operational use (serverless deployment, service instances per VM,
and service instances per container); and (5) Data storage – patterns oriented towards
improving performances of data management systems (database-per-service pattern, the
database cluster pattern, and the shared database server pattern). In addition, antipatterns
refer to design and implementation choices that result in inadequate/poor software system
design, leading to issues during operation and maintenance.

scenarios, and (c) by considering organizational factors and addressing human-related
issues in microservice architectures.
• To ensure the quality of microservice architectures, it is crucial to assess the associated
quality attributes, while considering their complex interactions and trade-offs. By
evaluating and addressing these attributes, researchers and practitioners can optimize the
performance, robustness, and overall effectiveness of microservice architectures. This
comprehensive assessment can help in developing resilient and adaptable systems.
• Focusing on the industrial adoption of microservices architecture, which involves several
crucial phases, including design, implementation, validation, operation, deployment,
maintenance, and testing of microservice architectural designs in practice. By emphasizing
these essential phases, organizations can effectively adopt microservice architectures and
reap the benefits of scalability, flexibility, and maintainability offered by this architectural
style.
• Standardizing microservice architecture, interfaces, and related aspects such as load
balancing, fault detection, and autoscaling.
• Designing fault-tolerant and event-driven/asynchronous microservices, particularly for
smart systems, fog applications, and IoT applications.
• Transitioning from specific solutions and their related validation to more general solutions
through fundamental research, reusable practices, and lessons learned.
• Addressing the complexities of the migration process from monolithic applications to
microservice-based architectures systematically, as well as tackling challenges related to
microservice identification, granulation, and proper design.
• Conducting additional systematic literature reviews that consider gray literature to compare
findings and challenges identified in both white and gray literature, extending existing
secondary studies to include the latest knowledge supplements, or exploring additional
databases for comprehensive coverage, and enhancing literature review approaches by
improving data extraction and synthesis methods, validity, and quality assessment of
primary studies.
All these research directions aim to advance our understanding of microservices architecture
research and facilitate the development of the best practices, standardized approaches, and improved
methodologies in this rapidly evolving field.
The analysis of the directions for future research reveals that they are numerous and diverse. This
can be attributed to the relative novelty of microservice architectures, and their unique, yet relatively
unexplored nature, characterized by heterogeneity, decentralization, and independence. The breadth
of future research directions signifies that the field of microservice analysis remains open to
innovations and methodologies.
This study provides a valuable roadmap for researchers, highlighting areas that require further
exploration. It also serves as a guide for practitioners, enabling them to assess the progress made
thus far and determine which tools and approaches are suitable for practical implementation.

5. Recommendations for future literature reviews
This section provides comprehensive recommendations for further literature reviews in the field of
microservices, encompassing primary, secondary, and tertiary studies. These recommendations are
drawn directly from the research findings of this study and aimed at enhancing existing research and
enriching the knowledge base on microservices. Recommendations relate to quality assessment of
selected studies, microservices architecture, life cycle issues, migration, technical implementation
in different domains, and further research directions.
123

Quality assessment of selected studies. According to guidelines for conducting literature reviews,
quality assessment of included studies is typically considered a mandatory component of SLRs,
whereas it may not be required for SMSs. Consequently, the quality assessment question Q4
received a low score of 0.37. Therefore, the primary recommendation for addressing this issue is to
assess the quality of all the studies selected for inclusion in the review and to establish a minimum
value threshold for study inclusion to maintain rigorous standards throughout the review process.
Architecture. Research about microservices architecture exhibits a significant level of research
maturity, particularly in the areas of architecture analysis, pattern utilization, and the adoption of
various methods for architectural representation. Moreover, considerable attention has been given
to exploring quality attributes and their associated trade-offs. However, the research findings
indicate that there is a need to assess quality attributes and metrics pertaining to granularity, runtime
architecture visualization, as well as specific quality attributes such as context awareness,
integrability, fault tolerance, upgrading, and availability.
Life cycle issues. Attention to life cycle issues, particularly the utilization of contemporary
approaches like DevOps and continuous software engineering practices (continuous integration,
continuous delivery, continuous deployment, and monitoring) increased in recent years. However,
human factor issues, domain-driven design, and specific maintenance and operation concerns need
more attention in further research.
Migration. The migration of legacy systems, typically characterized by monolithic architectures, to
microservice architectures is a challenging research topic. Numerous methods and tools have been
proposed and evaluated in real-world settings, forming a substantial knowledge base for
practitioners and researchers. Based on the study findings, it is evident that motivation and success
factors have not been sufficiently addressed in the existing research requiring further studies.
Technical implementation in different domains. Limited research has been documented in
research studies and literature reviews concerning the technical implementation of microservices
across various domains. Most of the research focuses on the initial development of microservicebased systems, with limited evaluations conducted in real-world settings. In addition, projects
carried out by academic institutions often lack involvement of industry experts. There is an evident
need to conduct implementation studies within real settings across different domains and to engage
industry experts to gain a more comprehensive understanding of microservice-based system
implementations.
Methodological issues for further research. Recommendations in the methodological areas are:
(1) Integration of gray literature aimed for complementing the insights obtained from white
literature, as well as for increasing understanding of the industry experts’ perspectives
and the current state of practice;
(2) Utilization of data extraction and synthesis methods from social sciences that enable
identification of patterns in practice and the development of theories necessary for
building and extending a knowledge base in this area of software engineering.

6. Conclusions
This tertiary study focuses on publication trends, research topics, domains of implementation, and
future research challenges in the domain of microservices. Conducted systematic literature review
resulted in the selection of 44 secondary studies that are used for deriving findings. Based on the
emerging findings, recommendations for further literature reviews are discussed. The main
contributions of this study are detailed and structured recommendations for future literature reviews,
which include improvement of quality assessment of analyzed studies, more detailed analysis of
architecture quality attributes, analysis of implementation in various domains of business and human
life, exploration of human factors and organizational issues, and addressing maintenance and
operation challenges. In addition, the inclusion of domain experts in the preparation and
implementation of these literature reviews is recommended for increasing the accuracy and validity

of the findings. And finally, the creation of multidisciplinary teams with experts from social sciences
(e.g., sociologists, psychologists, economists) will enable a more comprehensive approach to the
analysis of human and organizational factors at different stages of the microservice life cycle,
resulting in more comprehensive and reliable literature reviews.
From the methodological standpoint, it is recommended to use qualitative social science methods to
obtain more structured findings and methodologically grounded data analysis of unstructured text in
analyzed studies. This research recommendation will lead to the development of theories about the
practice, increasing the knowledge base in this area of software engineering.
