1. Introduction
We can see the internet as a cluster of systems and devices that share and deliver resources to other devices. Users
can request resources on demand through sessions and these resources are provided by services that can also be shared
between other services. The Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) represented a shift in the traditional client-serverbased systems architectures, exactly to be applied in such cluster of devices and systems. With SOA, clients and servers
are seen as merely services, having their composition and interoperability as the innovative behavioral contributions
[1], [2] . The microservice architectural pattern instead, represents a step forward on SOA, towards higher flexibility,
maintainability, and scalability on software components. Developing these kinds of services, that are significantly
smaller and independent, allow bigger systems to be decomposed into smaller systems [3]. Nevertheless, this
multiplicity of processes can represent more opportunities for an attack to breach the security of each of those systems
[4]. We are talking about web applications and the increase in security vulnerabilities on those type of applications
remains one of the most crucial problems of any information technology organization [5]. Furthermore, building large
or complex microservice-based applications with multiple client apps, represent an increased attack surface area, since
being autonomous, each microservice must care with its own security [6]. The pattern API Gateway [7], [8]represents
a way to deal with this, where a particular service provides a single-entry port for all involved services.
The focus of the proposed solution intends to improve security effectiveness over the communication layer. This is a
layer where the famous man in the middle attack (MITM) [9] usually happens [10], [8].
A different approach that has also been observed is using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), where each microservice uses
the information contained in the web token for authorization purposes. Eventually this token would get passed between
microservices and can create a flow problem known as “confused deputy problem” [11].
The current document describes a proposal to address efficiency concerns of microservices that use HTTPS and JWT
to secure messages, beyond the API gateway pattern. The goal is to gain both performance and time of implementing
such patterns.
2. Microservices Security
Microservices represents a new trend of architecture for the common Software Oriented Architecture (SOA).
According to the specifications, this new architecture allows services to be more autonomous, scalable, and deployable
in containers that can be managed by a cloud platform.

Fig. 1. Microservices scalability [6].

The scalability is inherent to the required change from the previous monolithic solutions to the new ones that are
distributed and technically agnostically hosted (Fig. 1): many instances, many technologies, available somewhere.
This new context exposes these services to several emergent security vulnerabilities [6]. Taking over one microservice
could lead to, for instance, a denial of service (DoS) on other microservices, that can imply flooding a service or
computer with a huge number of requests so that it cannot operate correctly [12]. Thus, while adopting a microservices
architecture to accelerate development and simplify maintenance, each microservice demands new security attention.
2.1. Attack Surface
When it comes to security, there is a main difference between SOA and Microservices architectures. A traditional
SOA usually has very few expositions to the internet. Instead, a microservice architecture approach, while delivering
scalable and easily maintainable applications, can offer a higher number of services exposed. Because of that, the
security risk of compromising one microservice which could compromise the rest is much higher. This is what is
defined as a higher attack surface [2], [4]. Each microservice must be a simple part of code that executes a restricted
set of functionalities. Indeed, each service represents a smaller attack surface. However, the large set of services
represents a large area that may be attacked. Nevertheless, a smaller attack surface can make simpler to develop
security patches.
2.2. Implementation Patterns
The API Gateway Pattern is a recommended pattern for microservices that can significantly reduce the attack surface
[13]. This pattern consists in having a single-entry point into the system. This entry usually routes the different requests
to their respective microservice [1]. Furthermore, not using this pattern in microservices is considered to be an antipattern, since it increases the system complexity that complicates their maintenance [14].Figure 2 shows the
architecture of the API Gateway pattern. All requests are made to a single point (API Gateway) that gets delegated to
other microservices that are never exposed to the exterior.
Another relevant concern that the API Gateway pattern mitigates is the cross-cutting concern [15]. A concern can in
software engineering can be defined as something that affects computer software. There might be different types of
concerns and different concerns, but for this article we will focus on the security functional concerns [16]. For each
published microservice, authorization and secure socket layer (SSL), security must be handled. With the API Gateway
pattern, the authorization can be centralized and located at the API Gateway level [17].

Fig. 2. API Gateway service [17].

When implementing the API Gateway service pattern, there are other patterns that should also be considered, since
they might have to also be part of the solution, to have the best implementation.
In order to forward the request from the API Gateway to the microservices one of two approaches is usually used: the
Client-Side Discovery pattern (CSD) or the Server-Side Discovery pattern (SSD) [18]. While the Client-Side

4

Michael Matias et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000–000

2263

Discovery pattern relies on querying a service registry which knows the location of the microservices, the Server-Side
Discovery pattern relies on a router that makes that query and then forwards the request. The second approach can
usually be found as being part of the cloud environment, while the first one has to be programmed locally [19].
Another pattern that is often used in conjunction with the API Gateway pattern is the Access Token pattern. The way
to communicate to the requested services the information about the user identification, authentication, and
authorization, that makes the request, is usually made with a JSON token, but represents a critical challenge [20].
There are advantages and there are also some drawbacks when implementing the API Gateway pattern. One problem
is related with the so called, a single point of failure. Indeed, if that API Gateway is not working properly, the
availability of the entire services is compromised. Besides the single point of failure, if the API Gateway is not scaled
properly, it can become a bottleneck. The bottleneck can be both on the development of the microservice or on the
usage of the service. Another disadvantage is that the API gateway will also require additional development and future
maintenance if it contains custom logic [17].
There are several approaches and pitfalls when it comes to find the best pattern for microservices. For that reason, a
study has been previously made to compare several approaches and their problems [1]. [1] summarizes perceived
harmfulness on the more common microservices anti-patterns. it should be emphasized that API Gateway pattern is
considered a bad practice [1].

2.3. Enhancing Microservices Communication Security
Several strategies, protocols and patterns exist to secure the information that “goes” from one point (service) to the
other. Two of the most common technologies used for this effect are Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
and JSON Web Token (JWT) [21].

2264

HTTPS is composed of an infrastructure of Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, a more secure version of
SSL, and a public key infrastructure (PKI) [22]. TLS operates before the application layer and provides end to end
encryption at the transport protocol layer. The public key infrastructure is composed by certification authorities (CAs)
which are trusted organizations that issue and validate certificates [22]. This secure protocol prevents the Man In The
Middle (MITM) attack, a commonly known security vulnerability. This kind of attack tries to take advantage of a
vulnerable connection that could either have HTTPS or an unverified HTTPS certificate. When that happens, the
attacker intercepts the traffic from point A to point B, accessing and modifying the message contents passing between
the two points [23].

Fig. 3. mTLS between microservices [24].

TLS is also known as a one-way TLS because it helps the client to identify the server that it is communicating with.
However, in a microservice paradigm, you often find out that mutual TLS (mTLS) is implemented, and this helps both
the server and the client recognize each other. In the following example the server could be interpreted as the “Order
Processing Service” and the client as the “Inventory Service”. Which leads the client to authenticate through the
certificate authority, and vice versa, given that both have their own public and private key pair signed by the trusted
Certificate Authority.
JWT is often used to develop stateless and secure RESTful web services. A stateless server needs to meet several
requirements such as i) initial empty set of constraints; ii) client and server separation; iii) each communication to the
server contains all necessary information to fulfill that request, i.e., no prior information is required; iv) the response
to a request should be cacheable or not-cacheable; v) the information from the server should be standardized; vi) the
architecture behind the system should be layered; and vii) the system should be able to send code to be executed by
the client [25]. It is stated that JWT is a form of stateless authentication that encodes data in a JSON format and
digitally signs it using for example a Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) algorithm. The token is
stored in the client and is checked by the server on each request to validate that the user is authorized to request a
particular data [25].
Following excerpt of data represents an example of JWT.

In this example of JWT (Base64Url encoded), the header “eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9” encodes
to {"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}. The payload “eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZ SI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIi

wiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9” decodes to {"sub":"1234567890","name":"John Doe","admin":true }. The verification
signature is the last part, “TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ”.
There are a few ways to share JTW between microservices. One approach is the Security Token Service, that
receives a JWT from the API Gateway, validates it, and then issues a new JWT token to send it to the appropriate
microservice. Figure 4 shows examples of this on steps 2 and 3 and steps 4 and 5.
Considering Microservices security or securing services-to-services communications among microservices, tokens
(JWT) and certificates (HTTPS) are, indeed, the common basilar supporting tools.
We can conclude that several JWT’s will be validated and created during a single API request. On top of that, all
this communication is being done over HTTPS which is an encrypted communication. This could eventually lead to
performance and latency issues which we will discuss in the following section.

Fig. 4. JWT sharing between microservices [24].

2.4. Performance and Latency
Despite the decreasing cost implication of the infrastructure associated with the use of HTTPS over the years, it
can still add direct and considerable performance costs that directly affect latency. Since the connection is encrypted,
it is not possible to cache upstream data. That leads to 2TB of “uncached” data and around 30% extra energy
consumption. These values will of course be lesser in the microservice context, however JWT also proves to have an
impact on performance, especially when the size of it increases beyond 20KB [26].
Considering IoT contexts, low latency communications will surely compromise systems efficiency, namely those
that deal with real-time analysis and decisions. Furthermore, securing low latency communications was proved to be
difficult, although there exist strategies to effectively deal with it [27].
2.5. Secure communication
Service-to-service communication is an inherent requirement of a microservices architecture and is susceptible to
attacks such as espionage and man-in-the-middle attacks [28]. HTTPS is preferred over HTTP basic authentication
because it not only encrypts user credentials but also verifies that the client is communicating with the intended server.
However, the use of HTTPS complicates the management of SSL certificates, especially in multi-machine
environments. This includes managing hazardous issuing processes and revoking certain certificates, including selfsigned ones [6].
Alternatives to this method include single-sign-on implementations such as SAML and OpenID, which are not only
effective for authenticating and authorizing users, but also for service-to-service authentication. The use of client

2266

certificates over TLS to confirm identities is an additional option, despite the operational difficulties associated with
their administration [6].
There are also third-party options, such as Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) over HTTP. HMAC
consists of hashing queries with a private key and sending the resulting hash along with the request. If the server's
private key successfully recreates the hash, the request is granted [6].
API keys are an additional method for microservice-to-microservice communication. Some systems utilize a shared
API key, whereas others utilize a pair of public and private keys. API keys are frequently favored due to their
simplicity, robustness, and convenience of use when combined with potent methods. In addition, they are more
straightforward than a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) communication. [6].
3. More effective and secure communication
The main problems that continue relevant to overcome are:
-

-

-

Latency: Utilizing HTTPS and JWT for secure communication between microservices may result in
performance and latency issues. This is especially important in IoT contexts, where low-latency
communications are essential for real-time analysis and decision-making. The hybrid approach proposed
seeks to circumvent these limitations by employing HTTPS and JWT only when strictly required.
Security: The transition from monolithic to microservice architectures has increased the attack surface and
introduced new vulnerabilities. While patterns such as the API Gateway can help mitigate these risks, they
also introduce new difficulties, such as the possibility of a single point of failure and the need for additional
development and maintenance if the gateway contains custom logic. The proposed architecture seeks to
increase security by verifying and decrypting encrypted JWT at the API Gateway prior to allowing the
request to proceed.
Efficiency: The proposed architecture seeks to increase the efficiency of microservices communication by
reducing development complexity and boosting performance. However, the effectiveness of this strategy
will depend on a number of variables, such as the classification level of the data, who has access to the
system network, and the security measures implemented to ensure a secure environment exists within the
system network after the API Gateway.

During this research and considered these handicaps, a proof of concept that involved NB-IOT was explored. A
huge amount of low frequency data being sent into the cloud, while keeping low latency, efficient communication, as
well as the exposure of the specific API to the attack surface, continuously monitored.
Fig. 5 represents the proposed architecture. It tries to mitigate the security risks as well as improving performance
to the microservice ecosystem. It is a mix between the use of HTTPS and JWT, instead of using any of it alone.
This architecture suggests to not use either HTTPS, or encrypted JWT beyond the API gateway. The following
points justify and explain what is intended with that:
1. We can assume that if we are correctly implementing the API Gateway pattern (see Figure 2), the private
network beyond that point is secure. MITM attack should not be a problem beyond that point, and the
communication should be significantly faster given that it is not encrypted.
2. We must assure that the encrypted JWT is verified and decrypted at the API Gateway before allowing the
request to go forward. This would also improve performance because we are not creating new tokens and
not validating existing ones. A few possible solutions to keep the context present across microservices
are:
a. Have a microservice append the unwrapped JWT to the request and forward that request to the
respective microservice after verifying that the token has access to the requested service. This
would work as Security Token Service, as seen in Figure 2, with the exception that we would not
be generating new JWT’s.
b. The second approach is simpler and is to append the token to the request and forward the request
to its destination.

Fig. 5. Proposal of Hybrid approach.

3. At the API gateway it is possible to choose to use HMAC as an additional layer of security to guarantee
the integrity of data. The HMAC process includes the following steps:
a. Message Hashing: Your API Gateway can generate an HMAC for the JWT after receiving the
request. This involves applying a hash function to the JWT and a secret key known only to the
API Gateway and the JWT service.
b. The API Gateway then transmits the HMAC and JWT to the JWT service. Importantly, HTTPS
is no longer being used for this transmission.
c. The JWT service receives the JWT and the HMAC for verification. It then generates its own
HMAC of the received JWT using its copy of the secret key.
d. The JWT service compared the HMAC it generated with the HMAC it received from the API
Gateway. If they are identical, transmission of the JWT was not tampered with. If they do not
match, the JWT service can reject the request because it indicates the JWT has been tampered
with.

The proposed architecture will i) significantly downsize the complexity of development of microservices given
that you will not need to manage any certificates for each internal microservice; ii) increase its performance and as a
result since no more encryption and decryption are in place through HTTPS; iii) decrease the computation value
because of not encrypting all internal network communication.
4. Conclusions and Future Work
In this investigation, we delved into the complexities of secure communication within a microservices architecture,
focusing on the challenges of latency, security, and efficiency when utilizing HTTPS and JWT. Based on our
investigation, we have proposed a hybrid strategy that selectively employs HTTPS and JWT. This strategy is
predicated on the premise that a properly implemented API Gateway pattern guarantees a secure private network
beyond the gateway, thereby reducing the need for encrypted communication and token validation within this secure
zone.
Our findings indicate that the proposed architecture could substantially simplify the development of microservices,
improve performance, and reduce computational costs. However, the effectiveness of this strategy depends on several
variables. These include the classification level of the data, access permissions to the system network, and the
implementation of measures to maintain a secure environment beyond the API Gateway within the system network.

It should also be noted that in most cases, if a MITM attack were to take place, there would be much higher concerns
than that attack, given that malicious actors are already in our internal network.
Even though our proposed architecture provides a plausible solution to the challenges of secure communication in
microservices, additional work is required to validate its efficacy. Future research could include benchmarking this
solution and supplying empirical evidence to support the advantages of the proposed architecture.
